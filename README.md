# vimfiles

[![Build Status](https://github.com/fsouza/vimfiles/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fsouza/vimfiles/actions?query=branch:main+workflow:Build)

## Getting started

If you like what you see here and wants to use it in your configuration, I
recommend forking it, as this is basically a personal configuration repo, so
it's unlikely that I'll accept pull requests changing configuration parameters.
I'll take PRs fixing or improving my code though :)

### Using with Neovim

Clone it in the configuration directory and use `make bootstrap`:

```
% git clone https://github.com/fsouza/vimfiles.git ${HOME}/.config/nvim
% make -f ${HOME}/.config/nvim/Makefile bootstrap
```
