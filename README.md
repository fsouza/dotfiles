# dotfiles

[![Build Status](https://github.com/fsouza/dotfiles/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fsouza/dotfiles/actions?query=branch:main+workflow:Build)

This is my personal dotfiles config. Most interesting bits are probably in the
nvim folder.

This is obviously intended for personal use, but there are bits that could be
converted into plugins. If you see anything that would be interesting/useful to
you, please feel free to open an issue.

## From scratch (macOS only)

Assuming you're me, you can run:

```
% curl https://fsouza.github.io/dotfiles/bootstrap.sh | zsh
```

I'm documenting this just in case someone is looking for inspiration on how to
do some things.
