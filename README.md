# dotfiles

[![Build Status](https://github.com/fsouza/dotfiles/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fsouza/dotfiles/actions?query=branch:main+workflow:Build)

This is my personal dotfiles config. Most interesting bits are probably in the
nvim folder.

This is obviously intended for personal use, and I share it here for
inspiration purposes.

## From scratch (macOS only)

Install, configure and signin to 1Password, then run:

```
% curl https://sh.fsouza.dev/bootstrap.sh | zsh
```

This should only really work for me, but again, it's being shared for
inspiration :)
